# Car Renting Web App

This is a front-end car renting project built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON**. It’s a single-page application where users can filter, sort, and view cars available for rent.

The main goal of this project was to highlight **JavaScript functionality** — including dynamic filtering, sorting, form handling, and data export.

## Features

- Filter and sort cars by name, price, type, etc.
- Create an account (data stored temporarily in browser memory)
- Admin dashboard with:
  - Full car list in a table
  - Ability to add new cars
  - Export car data as a `.CSV` file
- All interactions are done on the front end (no backend or database)
- Note: Data is not persistent — refreshing the page resets all changes

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- JSON

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser for user views 
3. Open the `admin.html` in your browser for the admin views
